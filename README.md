##Description
This repository contains the codes for the "DCSM" weakly supervised semantic segmentation method.  
It has been published at ECCV2016.  
Our codes are based on the Caffe deep learning library.  
##Requirements
Requirements for Caffe and pycaffe (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/))  
##Install
First, you should clone the repository as below.  
```
git clone https://github.com/shimoda-uec/dcsm.git
```

You need to compile the modified Caffe library.  
If you compile Caffe in own repository, you should locate our additional codes to your own Caffe library precisely.  
See additionalcodes/README.md.  
##Run the demo
See test/README.md.
